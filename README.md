# Natours project 
This is one of three project from the Advanced CSS project folder from Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann,
currently in progress, keep visiting to see the end product.
I have also deleted the node_modules folder so. one has to run npm i (to reinstall the folder) in the command prompt
To access this, as a developer, one has to open two command prompts and write: npm run compile:sass
and in the second: live-server
This works in situ. But if you do download to edit it you need the modules folder.
